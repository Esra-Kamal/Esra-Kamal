I’m passionate about using data to solve real problems, uncover opportunities, and support smarter decision-making. 

Over the past years, I’ve developed strong hands-on experience in:

🔸 Power BI (DAX, modeling, storytelling)  
🔸 SQL & Excel analytics  
🔸 Power Query & ETL processes  
 
I love building dashboards, automating processes, and transforming scattered data into clear, meaningful insights.
